#The goal of this Project is to propose a CNN for binary classification if two two types of xray images, pneumonia case and normal case

!nvidia-smi  # see which type of graphic card we use in collab (GPU)

# Mount into my google drive where i stored my datasets
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

#From scratch I wukk design a shallow CNN composed of a set of conv, pool and FC layers

# First i unzipped my Newdata file on my google drive and mounted my colab at it 

# I WILL DO THE DATA AUGMENTATION to augment our data by creating new images from our original ones by using scaling, zooming, ...
#our original images have pixel values between 0 and 255, so we will also normalize them to have values between 0 and 1.

Train_data = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255,shear_range=0.2,zoom_range=0.2,fill_mode="nearest",horizontal_flip=True,zca_whitening=False)
Test_data = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255,shear_range=0.2,zoom_range=0.2,fill_mode="nearest",horizontal_flip=True,zca_whitening=False)
Val_data = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255,shear_range=0.2,zoom_range=0.2,fill_mode="nearest",horizontal_flip=True,zca_whitening=False)

# Load our datasets from my google drive folder by specifying its directory 

# To generate a tf.data.Dataset from image files in a directory we do:

training_set = Train_data.flow_from_directory(r'/content/drive/MyDrive/chest_xray/train/',target_size=(300, 300),class_mode='binary') # which we will use for training
test_set = Test_data.flow_from_directory(r'/content/drive/MyDrive/chest_xray/test/',target_size = (300, 300),class_mode ='binary') # which we will use for testing or predecting
Validation_set = Val_data.flow_from_directory(r'/content/drive/MyDrive/chest_xray/val/',target_size = (300, 300),class_mode ='binary') # which we will use to improve our model accuracy and survey overfitting
